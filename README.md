# "Ser Benfiquista User Hide" browser extension

Hides or blurs ignored users on https://serbenfiquista.com/forum. **This is not an official extension.**

## How it works
 
The current way of ignoring users in SB is a bit flawed as you can still see quotes from the ignored users.
This extension targets the normal topic pages and best messages section. It will hide both direct and quoted messages.

This extension does not **modify or alter the original page html**. It uses CSS to hide the content instead.

## How to Use

There's 3 settings available.

- Ignored users, a comma separated list of the users to ignore. For ex: `user1,user2,user3`
